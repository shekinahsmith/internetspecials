Mobile Site Rebuild - https://www.internetspecials.com/?lp=2100

This repository was created prior to me joining the team and follows the structure previously used for our legacy sites for A/B testing. 

I was responsible for coding site layout and styling, creating interactive package grids and bundle comparison tools. Also, created the address the lookup. 

The webpack setup and the configuration for Vue was handled by another member of the team, as well as, the package recommendation tool.

## Tech Stack
- PHP
- jQuery/Javascript
- Vue
- Foundation 5

Pertinent Files For Resdesign: 
- `data/assets/mobile-c/`
- `data/landing_pages/2100/`
- `data/landing_pages/default/includes/mobile-c/`


This was my first introduction to Vue.js, however, the technical stack for this team was a bit old. Attempting to make our old PHP stack work within the bounds of Vue was incredibly difficult.
